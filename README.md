# cppforsummer
I am at holiday!! I love the sea!! 
Nevertheless, I love my body more than the sea so when I am staying in the shadows, I study cpp. 
This is my cpp diary. Not for human race, for my entertainment.

I am not stupid but I struggle to learn things out my pace. Thus, I struggle so much at school. I want to swing from the chandeliers sometimes when I get bored but still I am not even mid in some lectures. This is my cpp diary made exclusively for holiday.

PS!!!:
protect your skin from the sun ladies and gentlemen!!
don't go to the sun when the sun is directly attacking to your skin. 
always use spf. 30-50 is not about protection level, it is about time and spf50 do not last forever. 
renew it every 2 hours. 
let's age gracefully.
